AdditionGame 
Problem Statement
Fox Ciel is playing a game called Addition Game. Three numbers A, B and C are written on a blackboard, and Ciel initially has 0 points. She repeats the following operation exactly N times: She chooses one of the three numbers on the blackboard. Let X be the chosen number. She gains X points, and if X >= 1, the number X on the blackboard becomes X-1. Otherwise, the number does not change. Return the maximum number of points she can gain if she plays optimally.
Definition
Class: AdditionGame
Method: getMaximumPoints
Parameters: int[], int
Returns: int
Method signature: int getMaximumPoints (int[] cards, int times)
Examples
0)	3, 4, 5, 3
Returns: 13
The three numbers written on the blackboard are (3, 4, and 5). One possible optimal strategy is as follows:
Ciel chooses 5. She gains 5 points, and the numbers become (3, 4, 4).
Ciel chooses 4. She gains 4 points, and the numbers become (3, 3, 4).
Ciel chooses 4. She gains 4 points, and the numbers become (3, 3, 3).
She gains a total of 5+4+4=13 points.
1)	1, 1, 1, 8
Returns: 3
One optimal strategy is to choose a 1 in each of the first three turns, for a total of 3 points. The numbers then become (0, 0, and 0). After that, she won't be able to gain any more points.
2)	3, 5, 48, 40
Returns: 1140
The only optimal strategy is to choose the following numbers: 48, 47, 46, ... 11, 10, 9.
3)	36, 36, 36, 13
Returns: 446
4)	8, 2, 6, 13
Returns: 57
